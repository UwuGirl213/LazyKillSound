If its your first time doing this you should download [here](https://github.com/UwuGirl213/LazyKillSound/releases/download/Northstar_1.9.0/MOVE.TO.TITANFALL.2.FOLDER.zip) and extract 

"MOVE TO TITANFALL 2 FOLDER.zip" and copy it to your titanfall 2 Directory


# Uwugirl, it still doesnt work! :(
Ping @KingPiss#2446 if nothing works, dont be shy :)

# Problem fixes as of now
If you have S2 client kill callback:

dont install lazykillsound but replace the obituary file on the S2Clientkill

Download and move [cl_Obituary](https://github.com/UwuGirl213/LazyKillSound/releases/download/fix/cl_obituary.gnut) to S2.ClientKillCallback\mod\scripts\vscripts\client
